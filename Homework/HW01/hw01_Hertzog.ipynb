    "* Argue that B and C are related.\n",

For example, recall the study relating chocolate consumption (A) and heart disease (B).  If we were trying to argue that exercise (C) is the confounder here, then we need to do so in a way that explains why those who eat chocolate are **less likely** to have heart disease, instead of accidentally arguing that those who eat chocolate are **more likely** to have heart disease.   \n",

    "To give you practice, here's an actual example that I love because it's so counterintuitive.   One study found that the mothers in their study who bottle-fed their children actually had healthier babies than those who breast-fed.  This is unexpected because many claim that breast milk is so good for a baby.  The researchers decided that the confounding variable here was....wait for it...the mothers' education level.  I bet that wasn't the first thing that came to your mind!  Here's one possible way to argue that a mother's education level (C) is a possible confounder relatiing a women's chosen type of feeding (A) and the health of her baby (B).  There are other ways as well.  FYI: You may disagree with these statements and that's fine.  That's not the point.  The point is:  Can you provide a reasonable possible explanation for why the study saw what it saw?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A and C are related:  Women with higher education levels tend to have careers with long working hours.  Hence, they have to pump at work and are forced to rely on bottles.  Thus, women with higher education levels are more likely to bottle-feed.\n",
    "* B and C are related:  Women with higher education levels are likely to be in a better financial situation.  Thus, they have access to better healthcare options.  Therefore, they see a doctor more often during their pregnancies and so their babies tend to be healthier.\n",
    "* Check Consistency: We have argued that women with higher education levels are both more likely to bottle-feed and to have healthier babes.  Hence, the above arguments give a plausible explanation for why the researchers observed that women who bottle-feed are more likely to have healthier babies. (So the arguments do not accidentally argue **less likely**.)\n",
